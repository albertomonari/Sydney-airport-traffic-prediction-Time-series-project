The procedure used in this project was:
- the description of the time series (trend, seasonality, random component)
- study of stationarity
- transformation from non-stationary to stationary through log transformation, first order difference, difference of lag 12
- Box-Jenkins methodology to build a model
- residual diagnostic
- quality of the fit
- forecasting (in-sample and out-of-sample)
